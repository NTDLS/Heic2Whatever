# Heic2Whatever
Simply put, IOS loves HEIC images and the world of Windows dees not. Heic2Whatever is a no-nonsense way to convert those pesky suckers to a more universal format of your chosing.

Options for auto-resizing, file types and even thread count.

Definitly runs on Windows but suposedly also runs on Linux, and MacOS. Let me know. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Enjoy!
